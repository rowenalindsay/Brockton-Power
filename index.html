            <span class="drop-cap">I</span> live on the south side of Brockton, it’s called Campello. We have a train station and a sewage treatment plant and a recycling center,” said Kate Archard, a resident. “There are days when it smells, it just smells wrong.”

              <br /><br />On days like that, Archard’s daughter Jacki would struggle to catch her breath. She couldn’t go outside without taking her inhaler due to her asthma. It was particularly bad on hot summer days during ozone season. Down the street, a friend of Archard’s lived in a senior residence high-rise building. She could take a finger and wipe up the black soot that accumulated on her porch.

              <br /><br />Stories like these are common in Brockton, where overexposure to particulate matter in the air from the high concentration of polluting facilities has caused the city’s residents to suffer from abnormally high rates of environmental health conditions, including severe childhood asthma. According to Massachusetts Community Health Information Profile <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/researcher/community-health/masschip/asthma-mortality-and-hospital-data.html">(MassCHIP) data</a>, people in Brockton are hospitalized for asthma at twice the rate of the statewide average (324 per 100,000 people compared to 155), and they die of asthma at four times the rate of the statewide average (2.4 per 100,000 people compared to 0.6).

              <br /><br />That is why when Archard found out that Brockton Power Co. had submitted a proposal to build a 350-megawatt natural gas power plant—a facility that would emit even more particulate matter into the air—less than a mile away from the town’s elementary school and a senior housing community, she decided to fight back. She joined <a href="http://www.stopthepower.net/">Stop The Power</a>, a community organizing group working to prevent the plant from being built in Brockton.

              <br /><br />“I am a mother with a daughter who had asthma and I am an educator with the understanding that [the power plant] was being pushed right next to a school of children who were going to be outside playing at recess,” said Archard. She is a professor of business communication and ethics at University of Massachusetts, Boston. “Brockton already has a disproportionate level of childhood asthma rates as is. It is just not right.”<br /><br /></p>

              <br /><br />Brockton Power submitted its proposal to build the power plant in 2007 and for the past decade, residents of Brockton and the neighboring towns of East Bridgewater and West Bridgewater have been pushing back against the project due to public health concerns.

              <br /><br />A city of 95,000 people on Massachusetts’ South Shore, Brockton is a <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml">50.4 percent minority</a> community with a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/18/town-town-look-income-massachusetts/cFBfhWvbzEDp5tWUSfIBVJ/story.html">median income per household of $48,500</a>. The statewide median is $67,800. Communities with such demographics are often disproportionately exposed to pollutants and burdened by the associated health impacts compared with wealthier white communities.

              <br /><br />“Environmental injustices can also be considered to occur when specific communities, regardless of their racial, ethnic or class-based demographic profile, are overburdened by the presence of environmentally hazardous sites and facilities relative to other communities in the state,” said Daniel Faber, professor of sociology at Northeastern University and director of the Northeastern Environmental Justice Research Collaborative. “In this respect, Brockton is one of the most environmentally overburdened communities in the state.”

              <br /><br />In 2002, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) wrote an environmental justice (EJ) policy to ensure that state agencies act in a way that protects the most environmentally overburdened and vulnerable communities—communities such as Brockton, Chelsea, Lawrence, Lowell, Worchester, Roxbury and Springfield. But environmental lawyers, community organizers and people living in EJ communities echo the same refrain when it comes to the policy: It doesn’t go far enough.

              <br /><br />Currently, Brockton residents are appealing the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) conditional approval of Brockton Power’s permit, arguing that health data proves how overburdened their community is.

              <br /><br />“The power plant…contributes to fine particulate matter, which are very small particles suspended in the air,” said Jonathan Levy, a professor of environmental health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “If you’re a child with asthma or an older individual with diabetes or a history of heart disease, it is going to make the disease that you have worse. You’re going to have more frequent asthma flare-ups or a higher risk of heart attack. It can have a short-term effect when the event happens, and it can also just have a long-term effect on your health and wellbeing.”

              <br /><br />Regardless, the residents case was not going well when they were basing their argument on the 2002 policy. However, in 2017 the EEA released an <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/eea/ej/ej-policy-english.pdf">updated policy</a> with a new section that gives state agencies the option to consider health impacts when using the policy to protect EJ communities.

              <br /><br />With its status as an EJ community and record of environmental health conditions, Brockton is exactly the kind of community this new section of the policy was designed to protect. Considering the 2017 policy, the people of Brockton may be able to stop the power plant from being built, and if the policy holds up in court, it could set the precedent that EJ factors need to be considered in similar cases throughout the state.<br /><br /></p>

          <p class="col-sm-8"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>n 2002, the EEA wrote an EJ policy for the state of Massachusetts’ environmental agencies. The policy defined “environmental justice community” as “neighborhoods…that meet one or more of the following criteria: 25 percent of households within the census block group have a median annual household income at or below 65 percent of the statewide median income for Massachusetts, 25 percent or more of the residents are minority, or 25 percent or more of the resident have English Isolation.” It also set forth a series of strategies to ensure that people throughout Massachusetts would have equal access to the state’s natural resources and that no community would unduly bear the burden of environmental pressures.

          <br/><br />The policy was a step forward in codifying the problems that many low-income communities and communities of color face: proximity to hazardous waste facilities, poor air and water quality, lack of green space and high rates of lead poisoning and asthma—to name a few. However, the policy did little to change the agencies’ actions or improve life in EJ communities.  <br /><br /></p>

          <p class="col-sm-8"><br /><br />One of the main weaknesses of the policy was that it provided no way of looking at the cumulative effect of many hazardous facilities.

            <br /><br />“If any facility met its [<a href="https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a>, or NAAQS] requirements than the EJ policy was really ineffectual,” said Faber. “Then you can just put facility after facility after facility in Brockton and each one of those individual facilities can meet those permitting requirements, but the cumulative impact of them would be much greater.”

            <br /><br />The EJ policy relies heavily on NAAQS data. The policy allows for an enhanced review of the impacts of projects on EJ communities, but only when those projects don’t meet NAAQS requirements.

            <br /><br />“We were able to litigate the 2002 EJ policy before the MA Supreme Judicial Court (SJC)…and the SJC conducted judicial review of the case under the policy, but ultimately we lost, in large part because the thresholds for enhanced review under the 2002 policy were too high,” said Phelps Turner, former Alternatives For Community and Environment (ACE) lawyer who worked on the Brockton case. He is currently working for the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF).

            <br /><br />It isn’t just the Brockton case that has followed this pattern.

            <br /><br />“I have been testifying in EJ cases all over the state for years and we keep losing. We lose case after case after case,” said Faber. “I go in and show that here is a community that has been disproportionately impacted, it’s a low-income community of color so therefore that would seem unfair, from an environmental justice perspective, that…it is receiving yet another environmentally hazardous facility.”

            <br /><br />And even when the environmentalists win these cases it is usually not because of environmental justice. In 2006, Chelsea, an EJ community north of Boston, was working to stop a diesel power plant from being built on the Chelsea Creek across from the town’s only elementary school.

            <br /><br />“We were able to show that Chelsea’s air quality and our public health statistics were already so bad,” said Roseann Bongiovanni, executive director of <a href="http://www.greenrootschelsea.org/">Chelsea GreenRoots</a>. “We were saying Chelsea’s public health is already compromised before even adding in a dirty diesel power plant…but it wasn’t how we won our campaign.” They won on a permitting technicality.

            <br /><br />Frustrated activists from multiple communities including Brockton and Chelsea wanted the state to pay more attention to vulnerable communities. Finally they caught a break in 2014 when Gov. Deval Patrick signed <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/lawlib/eo500-599/eo552.pdf">Executive Order 552</a>, codifying environmental justice standards in Massachusetts.

            <br /><br />“What that executive order did was it essentially expanded the scope of environmental justice to all state executive agencies—not just the environmental agencies but also the Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Community Development, etc.,” said Neenah Estrella-Luna, a former lawyer for ACE who worked on negotiating the executive order and the 2017 EJ policy. “The other really important piece of it was that it required that an interagency group be created to review and revise the policy.”

            <br /><br />The executive order called for this new policy to be published within 60 days. It took until January 2017, two years after the order was signed.

            <br /><br />“On the face of it, the 2017 EJ policy is pretty much the same,” said Faber. “There wasn’t really much new there on which to build except for one key thing: If there is evidence of environmental health-related impact, that would constitute grounds for…the state to take additional actions, and [the state] has some discretion to determine what those actions are.”

            <br /><br />This new section in the 2017 policy defines vulnerable health EJ populations as communities that have higher than average rates of at least one of four <a href="https://matracking.ehs.state.ma.us/">health criteria</a>: emergency department visits for childhood asthma; elevated childhood blood lead levels; age-adjusted hospitalization for myocardial infarction (heart attack), and; low birth weight. To qualify, a community must exhibit one or more of these factors at greater than 110 percent of the state rate for a sustained period of five years.

            <br /><br />Brockton meets all four of these factors, as do several other communities in Massachusetts, including Chelsea, Worchester and Roxbury.<br /><br /></p>

            <br /><br />Essentially, this means that state agencies are not obligated to take this health data into consideration, but they can if they choose to. Many environmental lawyers, looking to use the new policy to bolster their cases were frustrated with this weak language

            <br /><br />“We need ‘shalls.’ This needs to be required,” says Amy Laura Cahn, a lawyer for CLF. “What would certainly be a win is if state agencies said ‘we aren’t just allowed to do a cumulative analysis, we aren’t just allowed to look at how it impacts the current baseline public health conditions. We are going to make the choice and do that as a matter of core.’”

            <br /><br />Estrella-Luna says that the purpose of this section was to give environmental agencies a way to reject projects, such as the Brockton power plant, in a way that minimizes litigation.

            <br /><br />“There are times, in my experience working with the environmental agencies, where they know that a project is bad and they struggle for a legal hook that is going to minimize potential litigation,” said Estrella-Luna. “All environmental agencies are petrified of litigation even though they always win. This gives them some of that leverage to use their discretion in a positive way.”

            <br /><br />However, the policy does not hold much weight if the agencies do not exercise that discretion. Exactly what is at the agencies’ discretion and what the agencies are required to do have been interpreted to mean different things. It could be a powerful tool for EJ communities, or it could continue to mean almost nothing.

            <br /><br />This is what is up for debate in the Brockton Power case.<br /><br /></p>
