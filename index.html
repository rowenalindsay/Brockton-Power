            <span class="drop-cap">I</span> live on the south side of Brockton, it’s called Campello. We have a train station and a sewage treatment plant and a recycling center,” said Kate Archard, a resident. “There are days when it smells, it just smells wrong.”

              <br /><br />On days like that, Archard’s daughter Jacki would struggle to catch her breath. She couldn’t go outside without taking her inhaler due to her asthma. It was particularly bad on hot summer days during ozone season. Down the street, a friend of Archard’s lived in a senior residence high-rise building. She could take a finger and wipe up the black soot that accumulated on her porch.

              <br /><br />Stories like these are common in Brockton, where overexposure to particulate matter in the air from the high concentration of polluting facilities has caused the city’s residents to suffer from abnormally high rates of environmental health conditions, including severe childhood asthma. According to Massachusetts Community Health Information Profile <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/researcher/community-health/masschip/asthma-mortality-and-hospital-data.html">(MassCHIP) data</a>, people in Brockton are hospitalized for asthma at twice the rate of the statewide average (324 per 100,000 people compared to 155), and they die of asthma at four times the rate of the statewide average (2.4 per 100,000 people compared to 0.6).

              <br /><br />That is why when Archard found out that Brockton Power Co. had submitted a proposal to build a 350-megawatt natural gas power plant—a facility that would emit even more particulate matter into the air—less than a mile away from the town’s elementary school and a senior housing community, she decided to fight back. She joined <a href="http://www.stopthepower.net/">Stop The Power</a>, a community organizing group working to prevent the plant from being built in Brockton.

              <br /><br />“I am a mother with a daughter who had asthma and I am an educator with the understanding that [the power plant] was being pushed right next to a school of children who were going to be outside playing at recess,” said Archard. She is a professor of business communication and ethics at University of Massachusetts, Boston. “Brockton already has a disproportionate level of childhood asthma rates as is. It is just not right.”<br /><br /></p>

              <br /><br />Brockton Power submitted its proposal to build the power plant in 2007 and for the past decade, residents of Brockton and the neighboring towns of East Bridgewater and West Bridgewater have been pushing back against the project due to public health concerns.

              <br /><br />A city of 95,000 people on Massachusetts’ South Shore, Brockton is a <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml">50.4 percent minority</a> community with a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/18/town-town-look-income-massachusetts/cFBfhWvbzEDp5tWUSfIBVJ/story.html">median income per household of $48,500</a>. The statewide median is $67,800. Communities with such demographics are often disproportionately exposed to pollutants and burdened by the associated health impacts compared with wealthier white communities.

              <br /><br />“Environmental injustices can also be considered to occur when specific communities, regardless of their racial, ethnic or class-based demographic profile, are overburdened by the presence of environmentally hazardous sites and facilities relative to other communities in the state,” said Daniel Faber, professor of sociology at Northeastern University and director of the Northeastern Environmental Justice Research Collaborative. “In this respect, Brockton is one of the most environmentally overburdened communities in the state.”

              <br /><br />In 2002, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) wrote an environmental justice (EJ) policy to ensure that state agencies act in a way that protects the most environmentally overburdened and vulnerable communities—communities such as Brockton, Chelsea, Lawrence, Lowell, Worchester, Roxbury and Springfield. But environmental lawyers, community organizers and people living in EJ communities echo the same refrain when it comes to the policy: It doesn’t go far enough.

              <br /><br />Currently, Brockton residents are appealing the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) conditional approval of Brockton Power’s permit, arguing that health data proves how overburdened their community is.

              <br /><br />“The power plant…contributes to fine particulate matter, which are very small particles suspended in the air,” said Jonathan Levy, a professor of environmental health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “If you’re a child with asthma or an older individual with diabetes or a history of heart disease, it is going to make the disease that you have worse. You’re going to have more frequent asthma flare-ups or a higher risk of heart attack. It can have a short-term effect when the event happens, and it can also just have a long-term effect on your health and wellbeing.”

              <br /><br />Regardless, the residents case was not going well when they were basing their argument on the 2002 policy. However, in 2017 the EEA released an <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/eea/ej/ej-policy-english.pdf">updated policy</a> with a new section that gives state agencies the option to consider health impacts when using the policy to protect EJ communities.

              <br /><br />With its status as an EJ community and record of environmental health conditions, Brockton is exactly the kind of community this new section of the policy was designed to protect. Considering the 2017 policy, the people of Brockton may be able to stop the power plant from being built, and if the policy holds up in court, it could set the precedent that EJ factors need to be considered in similar cases throughout the state.<br /><br /></p>
